# FTC-Robot
This is a robot that I created during the course of this summer as I was preparing for the Bucharest Twin Cup FTC competition.
There are 2 of us in a team and I am responsible for the whole design of the robot, while my friend writes the code for the program to run.
I am really happy with how this project turned out. of course, there were a few things that I could have done better, but nevertheless I am still pleased with the result and our performance.
This was a great learning experience and while building this robot not only did I learn many new things about FTC robots, but I also learned how to use Slack due to the Hack Club Arcade.
